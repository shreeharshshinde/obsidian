Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw
CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applications — bigger problems are
usually the **amount of data**, the **complexity of data**, and the **speed** at which it is
changing.

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that pro‐
vide commonly needed functionality. For example, many applications need to:

• Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later **(databases)**
• Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads **(caches)**
• Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways **(search indexes)**
• Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously **(stream processing)**
• Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data **(batch processing)**

In this book, we focus on three concerns that are important in most software systems:

- **[[Reliability]]**
	The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at
	the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‐
	ware faults, and even human error).
	
- **[[Scalability]]**
	As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should
	be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.
	
- **[[Maintainability]]**
	Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use
	cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.
